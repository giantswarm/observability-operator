# Introduction

The Observability Operator is in charge of configuring the Prometheus Agent instances running in workload clusters like remote write configuration, [sharding](sharding.md), [queue configuration](queue-config.md) and so on.

## Configuration Topics

- [Sharding](sharding.md) - Configure automatic scaling of monitoring agents based on time series count
- [Queue Configuration](queue-config.md) - Configure Alloy remote write queue parameters for optimal performance

TODO(atlas): Add operator specific documentation here ("sequence diagrams", list of created and managed resources)
