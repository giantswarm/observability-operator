## [0.33.1] - 2025-06-19

### Fixed

- Fixed TenantID validation for Alloy compatibility - was causing alloy to crash with some tenant names. Now follows alloy component naming requirements (https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/get-started/configuration-syntax/syntax/#identifiers), which is more restrictive than previously-used mimir requirements.

## [0.33.0] - 2025-06-16

### Added

- Alertmanager inhibition rule `cancel_if_metrics_broken`
- **Alertmanager version synchronization and dependency management**: Added comprehensive automated tooling to ensure Alertmanager fork version stays in sync with Mimir releases (https://github.com/giantswarm/giantswarm/issues/33621):
  - New script `hack/bin/check-alertmanager-version.sh` that compares the local Alertmanager version with the version used in the latest stable Mimir release
  - GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/check-alertmanager-version.yml` that runs the check on `go.mod` changes and can be triggered manually
  - Updated Renovate configuration to automatically track Mimir releases and ignore release candidates, alpha, and beta versions
  - Added comprehensive comments to `renovate.json5` explaining the Alertmanager version tracking logic
  - Updated `go.mod` comments to reference Renovate automation instead of manual version checking

### Changed

- Comprehensive Helm chart support for webhook configuration:
  - Made all webhook resources conditional (ValidatingWebhookConfiguration, Service, Certificate)
  - Added granular enable/disable controls for individual webhooks (``webhook.validatingWebhooks.alertmanagerConfig.enabled`)
  - Added `ENABLE_WEBHOOKS` environment variable configuration
- Replace the `prometheus/alertmanager` package with Grafana's Mimir fork (`grafana/prometheus-alertmanager`) to ensure configuration compatibility between our validating webhook and Mimir's Alertmanager. This change addresses a compatibility issue where the webhook validation logic used the upstream Prometheus Alertmanager config parser, while Mimir uses a fork with additional/modified configuration options. The replacement ensures 100% compatibility and eliminates the risk of configuration drift between validation and runtime. Uses version `v0.25.1-0.20250305143719-fa9fa7096626` corresponding to Mimir 2.16.0.
- Improved Alertmanager configuration validation script (`hack/bin/validate-alertmanager-config.sh`):
  - Automatically extracts the exact commit hash from `go.mod` replacement directive to ensure perfect consistency with webhook validation
  - Replaced binary building with `go run` for faster execution and simpler maintenance
  - Enhanced logging throughout the script for better debugging and monitoring
  - Now uses the exact same Grafana fork commit as the operator's webhook validation logic
- Enhanced AlertmanagerConfigSecret webhook with improved scope filtering and error handling
- Enhanced TenantID validation in GrafanaOrganization CRD to support full Grafana Mimir specification:
  - Expanded pattern from `^[a-z]*$` to `^[a-zA-Z0-9!._*'()-]+$` to allow alphanumeric characters and special characters (`!`, `-`, `_`, `.`, `*`, `'`, `(`, `)`)
  - Increased maximum length from 63 to 150 characters
  - Added validating webhook to enforce forbidden values (`.`, `..`, `__mimir_cluster`) and prevent duplicate tenants

### Fixed

- Fixed alertmanager configuration key consistency across codebase (standardized on `alertmanager.yaml` instead of mixed `alertmanager.yml`/`alertmanager.yaml`)
- Fixed error message formatting in `ExtractAlertmanagerConfig` function

### Removed

- Remove unnecessary Grafana SSO configuration override for `role_attribute_path` and `org_attribute_path`. Any override should happen in shared-configs instead.

## [0.32.1] - 2025-06-03

### Fixed

- Fix Alloy image templating when the alloy app is running the latest version.

## [0.32.0] - 2025-06-02

### Changed

- Updated Alloy configuration (`pkg/monitoring/alloy/configmap.go` and `pkg/monitoring/alloy/templates/monitoring-config.yaml.template`):
    - Conditionally set `alloy.alloy.image.tag` in `monitoring-config.yaml.template`. The operator now explicitly sets the tag to `1.8.3` if the deployed `alloy-metrics` app version is older than `0.10.0`. For `alloy-metrics` app versions `0.10.0` or newer, the image tag will rely on the Alloy Helm chart's defaults or user-provided values, facilitating easier Alloy image updates via the chart.
    - Adjusted indentation for `AlloyConfig` in `monitoring-config.yaml.template` from `indent 8` to `nindent 8`.
- Improve Mimir Datasource configuration (https://github.com/giantswarm/giantswarm/issues/33470)
  - Enable medium level caching (caching of `/api/v1/label/${name}/values`, `/api/v1/series`, `/api/v1/labels` and `/api/v1/metadata` for 10 minutes)
  - Enable incremental querying (only query new data when refreshing dashboards)

### Removed

- Remove old mimir datasource on all installations.

## [0.31.0] - 2025-05-15

### Changed

## [0.30.0] - 2025-05-14

### Removed
